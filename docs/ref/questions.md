:::{question} workflows
:::
## `workflows`

Choose a GitHub action workflow style to use for the project. The following ones are available:

org
:  The `salt-extensions` GitHub organization provides a repository with reusable workflows.

   Workflows will:

   * check `pre-commit` status
   * run the test suite on different OS and with different Salt versions
   * render and publish documentation
   * build and publish releases to PyPI

enhanced
:  Mostly equivalent to the centralized workflows of the organization, but part of the individual extension repository.

basic
:  Only provided for compatibility with the deprecated create-salt-extension tool. Should not be used in new projects.

:::{note}
Not asked when {question}`source_url` is not on GitHub.
:::

:::{question} deploy_docs
:::
## `deploy_docs`

Choose whether and when the rendered documentation is published to GitHub pages.

never
:  Don't publish documentation to GitHub pages at all.

release
:  Publish documentation only when a release is tagged.
   This ensures documentation is in sync with the released functionality.

rolling
:  Publish documentation after `push` and `tag` events to the default branch.
   This ensures upcoming unreleased changes are displayed in the changelog.

:::{important}
Publishing to your GitHub pages site requires the GitHub Actions workflow to be allowed to do so. In your repository `Settings`, ensure
`Pages` > `Build and deployment source` is set to `GitHub Actions`.
:::

:::{note}
Not asked when {question}`source_url` is not on GitHub or the `basic` {question}`workflows` have been selected.
:::

:::{note}
The current workflows do not support versioned documentation.
:::

:::{question} docs_url
:::
## `docs_url`

The URL of the hosted rendered documentation.

When publishing docs to GitHub pages via {question}`deploy_docs`, it's usually the corresponding pages URL.

Example: `https://salt-extensions.github.io/saltext-vault/`

:::{question} coc_contact

## `coc_contact`

A contact email address for Code of Conduct complaints.
