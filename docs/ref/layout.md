# Project layout
The following provides an overview of important paths in your Salt extension project.

:::{path} .copier-answers.yml
:::
## `.copier-answers.yml`
Copier-specific data. Saves the answers to the [template questions](questions-target) as well as the template's source URI and the last version the Salt extension project was updated to.

**Should never be touched manually.** If you want to change your answers to the [template questions](questions-target), use `copier update --trust` instead. If you want to avoid updating the template version, [pass the current one in `vcs-ref`](vcs-ref-target).

:::{path} CHANGELOG.md
:::
## `CHANGELOG.md`
Your Salt extension project's changelog file. Should not be updated manually, but by [invoking towncrier](changelog-build-target).

:::{path} README.md
:::
## `README.md`
Contains a brief description of your project and information for other developers. Contains a note about user documentation and â€“ if {question}`docs_url` was set, a link to the hosted docs.

:::{path} noxfile.py
:::
## `noxfile.py`
Defines several `nox` sessions. Contains glue code that [runs the test suite](run-tests-target), [builds documentation](build-docs-target) or lints your code.

:::{path} pyproject.toml
:::
## `pyproject.toml`
Defines your project metadata and (optional) dependencies, as well as configuration for several tools used during the lifecycle of a Salt extension repository.

:::{path} .github

:::{path} .github/workflows
:::
### `.github/workflows`
Root directory for your GitHub Actions {question}`workflows`.

:::{path} .github/workflows/ci.yml
:::

:::

:::{path} .github/workflows/pr.yml
:::
#### `.github/workflows/pr.yml`
Workflow triggered by Pull Requests and pushes to the `main` branch, including merges. Depending on {question}`workflows`, either calls the centralized workflows in [salt-extensions/central-artifacts](https://github.com/salt-extensions/central-artifacts/tree/main/.github/workflows) or the local equivalent at {path}`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

:::{path} .github/workflows/tag.yml
:::
#### `.github/workflows/tag.yml`
Workflow triggered by [tag pushes](publishing-target) for tags beginning with `v`. Depending on {question}`workflows`, either calls the centralized workflows in [salt-extensions/central-artifacts](https://github.com/salt-extensions/central-artifacts/tree/main/.github/workflows) or the local equivalent at {path}`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

:::{path} changelog

:::

:::{path} docs/ref
