Create and Maintain Salt Extensions
===================================

This is the documentation for `salt-extension-copier <https://github.com/salt-extensions/salt-extension-copier>`_, a Copier
template for creating and maintaining :ref:`Salt extensions <saltext-ref>`.

It is intended to be a one-stop shop for all topics related to the
lifecycle of Salt extensions, from creating (or extracting) an extension,
submitting it to the ``salt-extensions`` organization,
building the docs and releases and publishing it on PyPI.
