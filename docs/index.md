# Create and Maintain Salt Extensions

Welcome to the documentation for [salt-extension-copier](https://github.com/salt-extensions/salt-extension-copier), a [Copier template](copier-template-ref) designed for creating and maintaining [Salt extensions](saltext-ref).

This guide covers the entire Salt extension lifecycle, from [creating](creation-target) and [extracting](topics/extraction.md) extensions (as part of the [Great Module Migration](great-migration-ref)) to [updating](update-target), [writing tests](write-tests-target), [writing documentation](writing-docs-target), [publishing docs](docs-publish-target) and [releasing](publishing-target) on PyPI. It also includes information on [submitting](submitting-target) your project to the [`salt-extensions` organization](gh-org-ref) and several other topics.

That’s a lot to take in, but don’t worry – we’ve got you covered every step of the way!
