# Create and Maintain Salt Extensions

This is the documentation for [salt-extension-copier](https://github.com/salt-extensions/salt-extension-copier), a [Copier
template](copier-template-ref) for creating and maintaining [Salt extensions](saltext-ref).

It is intended to be a one-stop shop for all topics related to the
lifecycle of Salt extensions, from [creating](creation-target) (or - as part of the
[Great Module Migration](great-migration-ref) - [extracting](topics/extraction.md)) an extension,
[updating it](update-target), [writing tests](write-tests-target), [building](build-docs-target), [writing](writing-docs-target) and
[publishing](docs-publish-target) the docs through to [building](building-target) and
[releasing](publishing-target) your Saltext on PyPI and
[submitting](submitting-target) it to the [`salt-extensions` organization](gh-org-ref).

Wow, that's a lot. In short: We've got you covered!
