# Submitting your Saltext

Have you created a Salt extension project that you want to host
under the umbrella of the Salt extensions organization?

We're more than happy to receive you!

## Benefits
Hosting your project inside the organization will provide you with

* a properly setup repository with maintainer rights and
  working CI out of the box
* discoverability of your extension
* automated Copier template updates (in the future, not implemented yet)

## Requesting a repository
In order for us to provide you with a repository, please fill out
this [Repository request form](https://github.com/salt-extensions/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=repo&projects=&template=repo.yml&title=%5BRepo+request%5D%3A+) on GitHub.
