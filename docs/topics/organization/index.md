# The GitHub organization

## Goals
The [`salt-extensions` GitHub organization](gh-org-ref) was created in light of the [Great Module Migration](great-migration-ref).

Its goals are to

1. ensure users have a central contact point for all kinds of modules.
2. provide developers and contributors with a smooth development experience.
3. coordinate necessary efforts during the module migration.

## Getting involved
Whether you're fixing a bug, enhancing an existing extension, improving documentation, starting a new project, migrating existing modules out of Salt core or giving feedback, your contributions are welcome!

### Contact
There are several ways to get in touch with other members.

#### Discord
Many members are active in the [Salt community Discord][discord-invite] inside the `salt-extensions` channel.

#### Working group
The Salt Extensions working group meets in regular periods synchronously on Microsoft Teams. Check out the [Community calendar](https://saltproject.io/calendar/) or the one found on the Salt community Discord for upcoming meetings.

You can find the [meeting notes on GitHub](https://github.com/salt-extensions/community).

#### GitHub discussions
You can also post on the organization's [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/salt-extensions/discussions) forum.
