# Salt Extension for {{ integration_name or project_name.replace("-", " ").title() }}

{{ summary }}

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please refer
to [Salt's security guide][security].

## User Documentation

For setup and usage instructions, please refer to the
{%- if docs_url %}
[User Documentation][docs].
{%- else %}
module docstrings (for now, documentation is coming!).
{%- endif %}

## Contributing

The {{ project_name_full }} project welcomes contributions from anyone!

The [Salt Extensions guide][salt-extensions-guide] provides comprehensive instructions on all aspects
of Salt extension development, including [writing tests][writing-tests], [running tests][running-tests],
[writing documentation][writing-docs] and [rendering the docs][rendering-docs].

### Quickstart

To get started contributing, first clone this repository (or your fork):

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone --origin upstream {{ source_url | replace("https://", "git@") | replace("/", ":", 1) }}.git

# Change to the repo dir
cd {{ project_name_full }}
```

#### Automatic
If you have installed [direnv][direnv], copying the included `.envrc.example` to `.envrc` and
allowing it to run ensures a proper development environment is present and the virtual environment is active.

Without `direnv`, you can still run the automation explicitly:

```bash
python3 tools/initialize.py
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Manual
Please follow the [first steps][first-steps], skipping the repository initialization and first commit.

{%- if "github.com" in source_url %}

### Pull request

Always make changes in a feature branch:

```bash
git switch -c my-feature-branch
```

To [submit a Pull Request][submitting-pr], you'll need a fork of this repository in
your own GitHub account. If you followed the instructions above,
set your fork as the `origin` remote now:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_fork>.git
```

Ensure you followed the [first steps][first-steps] and commit your changes, fixing any
failing `pre-commit` hooks. Then push the feature branch to your fork and submit a PR.
